    ">First, the raw text of the document is split into sentences using a sentence segmenter, and each sentence is further subdivided into words using a tokenizer. Next, each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, named entity detection. In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence. Finally, we use relation detection to search for likely relations between different entities in the text."

    "The basic technique we will use for entity detection is chunking, which segments and labels multi-token sequences as illustrated in 2.1. The smaller boxes show the word-level tokenization and part-of-speech tagging, while the large boxes show higher-level chunking. Each of these larger boxes is called a chunk. Like tokenization, which omits whitespace, chunking usually selects a subset of the tokens. Also like tokenization, the pieces produced by a chunker do not overlap in the source text."

    " In order to create an NP-chunker, we will first define a chunk grammar, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular-expression rule [2]. This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (DT) followed by any number of adjectives (JJ) and then a noun (NN). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser [3], and test it on our example sentence [4]. The result is a tree, which we can either print [5], or display graphically [6]."

    "\n",
    "As befits their intermediate status between tagging and parsing (8.), chunk structures can be represented using either tags or trees. The most widespread file representation uses **IOB tags**. In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, I (inside), O (outside), or B (begin). A token is tagged as B if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged I. All other tokens are tagged O. The B and I tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g. B-NP, I-NP. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled O.\n",

    "##### Training Classifier_Based Chunkers\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the regular-expression based chunkers and the n-gram chunkers decide what chunks to create entirely based on part-of-speech tags. However, sometimes part-of-speech tags are insufficient to determine how a sentence should be chunked. For example, consider the following two statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)\t\t\n",
    "a.\t\tJoey/NN sold/VBD the/DT farmer/NN rice/NN ./.\n",
    "\n",
    "b.\t\tNick/NN broke/VBD my/DT computer/NN monitor/NN ./.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two sentences have the same part-of-speech tags, yet they are chunked differently. In the first sentence, the farmer and rice are separate chunks, while the corresponding material in the second sentence, the computer monitor, is a single chunk. Clearly, we need to make use of information about the content of the words, in addition to just their part-of-speech tags, if we wish to maximize chunking performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that we can incorporate information about the content of words is to use a classifier-based tagger to chunk the sentence. Like the n-gram chunker considered in the previous section, this classifier-based chunker will work by assigning IOB tags to the words in a sentence, and then converting those tags to chunks. For the classifier-based tagger itself, we will use the same approach that we used in 1 to build a part-of-speech tagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic code for the classifier-based NP chunker is shown. It consists of two classes. The first class [1] is almost identical to the ConsecutivePosTagger class from 1.5. The only two differences are that it calls a different feature extractor [2] and that it uses a MaxentClassifier rather than a NaiveBayesClassifier [3]. The second class [4] is basically a wrapper around the tagger class that turns it into a chunker. During training, this second class maps the chunk trees in the training corpus into tag sequences; in the parse() method, it converts the tag sequence provided by the tagger back into a chunk tree.\n"
