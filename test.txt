Programming is a skill that is acquired over several years of experience with a variety
of programming languages and tasks. Key high-level abilities are algorithm design and
its manifestation in structured programming. Key low-level abilities include familiarity
with the syntactic constructs of the language, and knowledge of a variety of diagnostic
methods for trouble-shooting a program which does not exhibit the expected behavior.
This section describes the internal structure of a program module and how to organize
a multi-module program. Then it describes various kinds of error that arise during
program development, what you can do to fix them and, better still, to avoid them in
the first place.
